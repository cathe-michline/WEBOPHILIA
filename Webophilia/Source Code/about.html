  <p class="lead">The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).</p>

<h1 class= "display-4">Origin</h1>
<p>On 31 December 2019, health authorities in China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei,and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.</p>
<p>Several of the early cases had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin. The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS‑CoV‑2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,pangolin coronaviruses,and SARS-CoV</p>
</div><br>
<div class = "content rounded">
<h1 class = "display-4">How the Virus spreads?</h1>
<p>It spreads between people very efficiently and sustainably—easier than influenza but not as easily as measles.This occurs mainly when people are in close contact (two metres or six feet) via small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking.Contaminated droplets exhaled by infected people are then inhaled into the lungs, or settle on other people's faces to cause new infection.The droplets are relatively heavy, usually fall to surfaces, and do not travel far through the air.People can transmit the virus without showing .</p>

<h1 class ="display-4">The pandemic in India</h1>
<p>The first case of the COVID-19 pandemic in India was reported on 30 January 2020, originating from China.India currently has the fourth largest number of confirmed cases in Asia with number of cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May 2020.The highest single day surge in new cases was recorded on 20 May 2020, when 5,611 cases were reported.[9] India's case fatality rate is relatively lower at 3.09%, against the global 6.63% as of 20 May 2020.The outbreak has been declared an epidemic in more than a dozen states and union territories.</p>
<p>On 22 March 2020, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the prime minister.Further, on 24 March, the prime minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population of India.On 14 April, the prime minister extended the ongoing nationwide lockdown till 3 May.[17] On 1 May, lockdown across the country was further extended by two more weeks till 17 May.</p>
<p>The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), in its report based on data from 73 countries, reports that the Indian Government has responded more stringently than other countries in tackling the pandemic. It noted the government's swift action, emergency policy making emergency investment in healthcare, fiscal measures, investment in vaccine research and active response to the situation, and scored India with a "100" for its strictness.</p>

<h1 class="display-4"> Signs and Symptoms</h1>
<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.</p>

<h1 class = "display-4">Measures taken in India</h1>
<p>On 14 March, scientists at the National Institute of Virology isolated a strain of the novel coronavirus. By doing so, India became the fifth country to successfully obtain a pure sample of the virus.According to estimates, India has around 40,000 ventilators, of which 8,432 are with the public sector.Testing for community transmission began on 15 March. 65 laboratories of the Department of Health Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research (DHR-ICMR) have started testing random samples of people who exhibit flu-like symptoms and samples from patients without any travel history or contact with infected persons.</p>
	
<p>On 12 April, the ICMR invited health institutions and hospitals to participate in trials of convalescent plasma therapy and plasma exchange therapy.However, the ICMR later stated that there is no robust evidence. It has some risks, which include life-threatening allergies and lung injuries & hence started multi-centre clinical trials to ensure the treatment's safety and efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients across the country.</p>
